# LLM Trainer Framework Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the LLM Trainer framework, a modular system for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with an initial focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The framework follows a modular architecture with these key components:

### 1. Data Processing

- `BaseDataProcessor`: Abstract base class for all data processors
- `ReasoningDataProcessor`: Specialized processor for reasoning datasets
- Supports loading, preprocessing, tokenizing, and saving datasets

### 2. Training

- `BaseTrainer`: Abstract base class for all trainers
- `QLoraTrainer`: Implementation of QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) training
- Supports 4-bit quantization, gradient checkpointing, and efficient fine-tuning

### 3. Evaluation

- `BaseEvaluator`: Abstract base class for all evaluators
- `ReasoningEvaluator`: Specialized evaluator for reasoning tasks
- Supports loading models, running inference, and calculating metrics

### 4. Utilities

- Configuration management with YAML files
- Standardized CLI for all components
- Helper scripts for using fine-tuned models

## Current Implementation

The initial implementation focuses on:

- **Model**: Llama 3 8B
- **Task**: Enhanced reasoning
- **Dataset**: facebook/natural_reasoning
- **Technique**: QLoRA with 4-bit quantization
- **Sequence length**: 2048 tokens

## Usage Flow

1. **Process Dataset**: `python main.py process --config configs/llama3_reasoning.yaml`
2. **Fine-tune Model**: `python main.py train configs/llama3_reasoning.yaml`
3. **Evaluate Model**: `python main.py evaluate --model_path ./output/llama3_reasoning`
4. **Use Model**: `python main.py use --adapter_path ./output/llama3_reasoning --interactive`

## Google Colab Integration

A Jupyter notebook is included for running the training process on Google Colab with GPU acceleration:
- `notebooks/llama3_reasoning_finetuning.ipynb`

## Extension Points

The framework is designed for easy extension:

1. **New Data Processors**: Create new subclasses of `BaseDataProcessor` for different datasets
2. **New Training Methods**: Implement alternatives to QLoRA by subclassing `BaseTrainer`
3. **New Evaluation Methods**: Add specialized evaluators by subclassing `BaseEvaluator`
4. **New Models**: Update configuration files to support different base models

## Next Steps

1. Extend to additional domains (SQL, code, domain-specific knowledge)
2. Add support for more advanced fine-tuning techniques
3. Integrate with model serving frameworks
4. Add monitoring and visualization tools
